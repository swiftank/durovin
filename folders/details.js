Math is an essential skill for machine learning, as many of the algorithms used in machine learning are based on mathematical concepts. Here are some key areas of math that are important for machine learning:

Linear Algebra: Linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with matrices, which are fundamental to many machine learning algorithms such as deep learning. Concepts like eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and matrix decomposition are used extensively in machine learning.

Calculus: Calculus is used in optimization techniques such as gradient descent, which is used to minimize the loss function in machine learning algorithms. Understanding concepts like derivatives and integrals is crucial for working with these techniques.

Probability and Statistics: Probability and statistics are essential for understanding and building models in machine learning. Concepts like probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference are used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and make predictions.

Optimization: Optimization techniques are used to find the optimal solution to many problems in machine learning. Understanding optimization techniques such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and convex optimization is important for building and improving machine learning models.

Graph Theory: Graph theory is used to model relationships between data points, such as in social network analysis or recommender systems. Concepts like graph algorithms and centrality measures are used in many machine learning applications.



Basic Maths 
Basic math includes the fundamental concepts and operations that form the foundation of mathematics. Here are some of the key areas of basic math:

Numbers: Numbers are the building blocks of math. Basic math includes understanding the different types of numbers such as natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers.

Arithmetic Operations: Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are used to perform calculations and solve problems.

Fractions and Decimals: Fractions and decimals are essential concepts in basic math. Understanding how to convert fractions to decimals and vice versa and how to perform operations on them is important.

Geometry: Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects. Basic geometry includes understanding concepts such as lines, angles, triangles, circles, and polygons.

Measurement: Measurement involves determining the size, length, or amount of something. Basic measurement includes units of length, weight, volume, time, and temperature.

Percentages: Percentages are used to represent parts of a whole. Basic math includes understanding how to calculate percentages, and how to use them to solve problems.

These are some of the key areas of basic math. A good understanding of these concepts is essential for building a solid foundation in mathematics and for progressing to more advanced math topics.

Multiply Tricks 

39 * 8 = (40 * 8) - ( 1*8 ) Answer
47 * 9 = (50 * 9) - ( 3*9 ) Answer

312  = 320 - 8 = 312
423  = 450 - 27 = 423
